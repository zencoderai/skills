# Git (Secure Clone)

Gate every `git clone` of a public repository with an automatic security assessment. Private/org repos clone immediately with no added friction.

## Trigger

Any user request that involves cloning, checking out, or installing a Git repository.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the repo URL

Extract `<host>`, `<owner>`, and `<repo>` from the URL or shorthand the user provided.

Accept common forms: `https://github.com/org/repo`, `git@github.com:org/repo.git`, `org/repo` (assume GitHub when no host). Normalize to an HTTPS URL.

### 2. Probe: public or private?

Run this host-agnostic check (no API key needed):

```bash
GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 \
GIT_ASKPASS=/bin/false \
git -c credential.helper= -c http.extraheader= \
  ls-remote --heads <normalized-https-url> 2>&1
```

| Outcome | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Succeeds (exits 0, prints refs) | Repo is publicly readable | **Run the security gate (Step 3)** |
| Fails (auth error / 404) | Repo is private or restricted | **Clone directly** — skip the gate |
| Fails (network / DNS error) | URL is invalid or unreachable | **Report the error**, do not clone |

When in doubt (rate-limited, ambiguous result), treat as public and run the gate.

### 3. Security gate (public repos only)

Read and execute the full assessment defined in the `oss-security-check` skill (`../oss-security-check/SKILL.md`).

Pass it:
- `<url>` — the normalized HTTPS URL
- `<owner>/<repo>` — extracted from the URL
- `<host>` — the git host
- Context: "This is a git repository the user wants to clone"

Wait for the assessment to complete. Present the results to the user.

### 4. User decision

After presenting the assessment, ask the user:

- **Clone** — proceed with the clone to the requested location
- **Clone to sandbox** — clone to a temporary/isolated directory instead
- **Abort** — do not clone

### 5. Execute the clone

If approved, run the clone. If the recommendation was "medium" or "high" risk, remind the user:

- Use read-only / scoped tokens if the tool needs credentials
- Prefer a throwaway repo for first use
- Look for a `--dry-run` mode before running with real data

### 6. Cleanup

The `oss-security-check` skill handles cleanup of its temporary shallow clone.

## Customization

The public/private probe in Step 2 is generic. Teams should replace it with a check specific to their environment. For example:

- **GitHub org allowlist:** skip the gate for repos in your org
- **Internal registry:** skip for packages from your private registry
- **Domain allowlist:** skip for repos hosted on your company's GitLab instance

Ask your AI agent: *"Modify the git skill so that repos in the `<your-org>` GitHub organization skip the security gate, and all other public repos are scanned before cloning."*

## Notes

- Private repo clones are unaffected — zero added latency.
- Public repo gate adds ~30-60 seconds (web search + code scan).
- This skill does NOT replace thorough security review for production dependencies. It is a fast first pass.
