# AGENTS.md Generator

Analyze a codebase and generate a concise, accurate `AGENTS.md` contributor guide.

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS or the current working directory.

---

## Gather Information

Collect facts about the repository. **Only record what is actually found — never invent information.**

These probes are independent — run them in parallel (e.g., dispatch subagents) when the tooling supports it.

### Repository structure

Map the repo structure (3 levels deep, excluding .git, node_modules, dist, build, __pycache__, .venv). This is analysis input — the output AGENTS.md should describe non-obvious architecture, not list directories. Focus on the "big picture" that requires reading multiple files to understand.

### Build & dev commands

Extract actual command definitions from the project's build system: `package.json` scripts, `Makefile` targets, `pyproject.toml` scripts, `Cargo.toml` bins/workspace members, `go.mod` module path, `docker-compose.yml` services. Skip any that don't exist.

### Coding conventions

Check for and record key settings of:

- Linter configs
- Formatter configs
- Type checking (note strict mode if applicable)
- Agent rules: `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Pre-commit hooks

If agent rules files exist, read and extract the important parts — focus on conventions that matter for code generation, not verbatim content.

### Git history

Review the last 20 commits to identify commit message conventions and patterns. If this fails (not a git repo or shallow clone), note the limitation and skip.

### Existing documentation

- If `README.md` exists, read it for context about the repo's purpose and setup.
- If `AGENTS.md` already exists, read it — you'll be improving it rather than starting fresh.
- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, read it for additional context.

## Generate AGENTS.md

### Document requirements

- Title: `# Repository Guidelines`
- 200-400 words (exceed only if complexity genuinely demands it)
- Direct, instructional tone
- No repetition across sections

### Sections to include (omit any that lack evidence)

**## Project Structure & Module Organization**
Architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand. Omit anything obvious from opening a single file.

**## Build, Test, and Development Commands**
Actual commands from the build system. Include how to run a single test.

**## Coding Style & Naming Conventions**
Enforced rules from linter/formatter configs. Include tool names.

**## Testing Guidelines**
Test framework, how to run tests, coverage requirements if any.

**## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines**
Commit conventions derived from actual git history. Note any PR templates.

Add other sections only if facts strongly support them (e.g., Architecture Overview, Agent Instructions).

### What to never include

Do not include generic development practices such as:
- "Write unit tests for all new utilities"
- "Use meaningful variable names"

Do not invent sections like "Common Development Tasks" or "Tips for Development" unless the repo's own documentation expressly contains them. Do not list every file — only document what is non-obvious.

### New vs existing

- **Existing AGENTS.md:** Fix inaccuracies, fill gaps, remove generic advice, ensure commands are current. Preserve correct, specific content. Present the diff and ask to confirm before overwriting.
- **New AGENTS.md:** Write directly to the repository root. No confirmation needed.

---

## Validate

Before finalizing, verify:

- Every command mentioned actually exists in the build system
- Every file path mentioned exists in the repo
- No generic advice slipped in
- No repeated information across sections
- The document stays within the target word count
- Agent rules are incorporated (woven into relevant sections, not dumped verbatim)

---

## Principles

- **Never fabricate** — if a section has no evidence, omit it entirely
- **Prefer commands over prose** — `npm test` over "run the test suite"
- **Big picture only** — architecture that spans multiple files, skip the obvious
- **Incorporate agent rules** — weave important parts of .cursorrules or copilot instructions into relevant sections
- **Respect existing work** — in improvement mode, preserve correct specific content
- **Conciseness is quality** — every sentence must earn its place
